### TA Demo, which has "ModResorts" and "CustomerOrderService" apps (Can do zero to hero with Modresorts incuding migration bundle)

### Use TA Archive "klp-AppSrv01-cos.zip" in the cloned repo.


### -> Migration Bundle downloaded to "Downloads" and unzipped already... 
    Note: I commented out the line for that loads from Liberty "apps" folder. I will use "dropins" 
      <!--  <webApplication contextRoot="/resorts" location="modresorts-1.0.war"/> -->
 


#### install Liberty from archive  (Use file explorer to unpack zip file)
/home/techzone/liberty_admin_pot/TA-demo-artifacts/Liberty-Base.zip


#### go to Liberty and create server and start it
 
 cd /home/techzone/liberty_admin_pot/TA-demo-artifacts/Liberty-Base/wlp/bin
 
 ./server create server1
 ./server start server1
 
 
 Copy /home/techzone/Student/LabFiles/modresorts-1.0.war to "Server1 "dropins" folder
 
 --> See messages.log that app is started 
 

### mod resorts app
